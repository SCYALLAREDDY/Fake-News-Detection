# Fake-News-Detection
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as either REAL or FAKE. We use a dataset of news articles and employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess the text and train a classifier. The model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics to ensure its effectiveness.
